<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

I'm an Information Assurance professional in Cybersecurity who enjoys collaborating with people and organizations to manage and secure systems.

I have a simple approach to stakeholders: set appropiate expectations, identify a root cause, pull together all necessary resources, solve the problem at hand. I enjoy working across multi-functional teams to understand an organization at multiple levels, because I care about making an impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy cars (track days and AutoX), Motorsports such as Formula 1, technology, coffee, photography, and travel! 🔥

<h3 align="center">Career Journey</h3>

My career journey began in the heart of national defense, where I cut my teeth at NAVAIR as an IT Specialist and Operations Research Analyst 👨‍💻. What started as an internship quickly evolved into leading major cybersecurity compliance efforts—supporting lab environments, designing asset tracking systems, and even orchestrating a full tech refresh for over 60 machines and servers. I thrived at the intersection of tech and process improvement, where every workflow optimized and every dashboard built helped strengthen mission-critical systems. Whether it was building a Foreign Travel Module or training users on secure system practices, I found joy in problem-solving and creating tools that actually made a difference 🛠️.

From there, I took a leap into the world of consulting at Deloitte 🚀. Working with the Navy's sustainment and logistics operations, I led digital transformation efforts that spanned coast to coast—from public shipyards to aircraft depots. I translated stakeholder pain points into real, measurable change through thoughtful strategy, process redesign, and innovative tech pilots. Presenting digital modernization strategies directly to Navy leadership was both exhilarating and rewarding, and it cemented my role as a trusted advisor in complex, compliance-heavy environments ⚓.

Currently, I’m sharpening my skills even further at AVER LLC, first supporting CISA’s cybersecurity mission and now as the Master Scheduler for a multi-agency ERP modernization effort at ICE 📊. My role blends the technical with the strategic—leveraging tools like Microsoft Project and ServiceNow to forecast risks, align dependencies, and keep executive leadership one step ahead. Whether it’s driving cyber resiliency or delivering cross-agency IT projects, I’ve remained focused on one thing: making government systems smarter, safer, and more efficient 💡🇺🇸.
