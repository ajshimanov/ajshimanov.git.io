<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

I'm an Information Assurance professional in Cybersecurity who enjoys collaborating with people and organizations to manage and secure systems.

I have a simple approach to stakeholders: set appropiate expectations, identify a root cause, pull together all necessary resources, solve the problem at hand. I enjoy working across multi-functional teams to understand an organization at multiple levels, because I care about making an impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy cars (track days and AutoX), Motorsports such as Formula 1, technology, coffee, photography, and travel! 🔥
